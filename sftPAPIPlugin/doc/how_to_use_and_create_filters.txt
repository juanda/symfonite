How to use and create filters
=============================

Once the user attributes have been retrieved thanks to the connector, the PAPI
framework can filter them before the PAPI assertion is builded and sent.

How to use the filters
----------------------
You can use the available filters which are listed and described in the document
'filters.txt'. In order to use these filters you must add them to the filters
section of the app.yml file as follows:

[yaml]
...
   sft_papi_plugin_filters:
     sequence:
       filter_reference:
         class_name: nameOfTheClassImplementingTheFilter
         configuration:
            param1: value1
            param2: value2

You can add as many filters as you want to the sequence. The documentation
of each filter must explain the correct values of its parameters.

How to create new filters
=========================
Create a new filter is as easy as create a new class wich defines an public
static method called 'execute($attributes, $configuration)'. Such method must
get as the first argument the attributes array and as the second an array with
the configuration defined in the app.yml file. The method must return an array
with the filtered attributes.

Take a look at the classes defined in the 'lib/filters' directory to see how
simple is a filter implementation.
