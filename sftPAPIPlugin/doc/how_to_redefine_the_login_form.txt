How to redefine the login form
==============================

There are two possible scenes in which you have to redefine the login form:

1. You would like to change the graphical design.

2. The connector you are developping needs other data different of the classical
'username' and 'password'.

In both cases, you have to use a symfony form object, so you should know how the
symfony forms work.

In the first case, you have to add a new template wich render the form as you
like. The template is a PHP file which must be put in the directory:
'modules/sftPAPIAS/templates', and must be named
{connector_name}SigninSuccess.php. For example, if the connector is named
'array', then the form template will be: arraySigninSuccess.php.
You can copy the content of the 'modules/sftPAPIAS/templates/signinSuccess.php'
file and modify it.

In the second case, you have to add a symfony form class which defines the
form you need. This class must be named {connector_name}SigninForm and should
live in the connector directory. In our array connector example:
'lib/connectors/array/arraySigninForm.class.php' would be hold the class.
If you also need to change the form template, you can do it as explained in the
first case.
